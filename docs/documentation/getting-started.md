# Welcome to ReadMe

Welcome to your new developer hub—AI-powered, Git-backed, and built to help your docs evolve with your product.

Edit this starter page or delete it to start fresh.

## ✍️ Write Docs with Components & Guides

Create **Guides** to walk users through key concepts, tutorials, or best practices. Use ReadMe's MDX editor to combine Markdown and custom JSX components like `<Card>`, `<Tab>`, and `<Accordion>` for richer content. You can also [build your own custom **Components**](/docs/getting-started#/settings/custom-components/start).

<Cards columns={3}>
  <Card title="Explore the Component Marketplace" href="https://github.com/readmeio/marketplace/tree/main/components" icon="fa-store" target="_blank">
    Drop in and customize components.
  </Card>

  <Card title="MDX (Markdown + JSX)" href="https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/mdx" icon="fa-code">
    Learn more about MDX to build interactive components.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom MDX Components" href="https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/building-custom-mdx-components" icon="fa-wrench">
    Build your own components to reuse anywhere.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Enable a **<Anchor label="Landing Page" target="_blank" href="https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/landing-page">Landing Page</Anchor>** to welcome developers and direct them to key docs.

## 🌿 Edit, Preview, and Publish in Branches

<Anchor label="Branches" target="_blank" href="https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/branches">Branches</Anchor> bring Git-style workflows to your documentation. Use them to draft changes, review updates, share feedback, and iterate safely. Merge branches back into a live version when ready.

## 🔁 Sync with Git

ReadMe integrates with your workflow:

*   **[Bi-Directional Sync with GitHub](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/bi-directional-sync)**: Connect a GitHub repo to sync changes between Git and ReadMe.
*   **Sync Your OpenAPI Files**: Use [`rdme`](https://docs.readme.com/docs/rdme#upload) or the ReadMe API to keep your API Reference up to date.

## 👀 Understand Your Developers

**<Anchor label="My Developers" target="_blank" href="https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/developer-dashboard">My Developers</Anchor>** gives you real-time visibility into who is visiting your docs and how they're using your API.
